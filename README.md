# Custom Share Button Plugin

The Custom Share Button Plugin is a simple WordPress plugin that allows users to share posts via a custom share button.

## Installation

1. Upload the `custom-share-button` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress Plugins menu.
3. Use the `[custom_share_button]` shortcode in your posts or pages to display the share button.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the share button by editing the CSS file `custom-share-button.css` located in the plugin directory. You can also change the image for the share icon by replacing the corresponding graphic file in the plugin directory.

## Credits

This plugin was created by KRISÃš and is based on the idea of the Custom Share Button by Matthias Pfefferle.
